                    <p>
                    Gamer, sports enthusiast, festival hunter and all around 
                    genuine human being. Some people like only 1 of those things
                    I mentioned and rarely do they usually like all of them.
                    I feel like this makes me a highly unique person and one that
                     can easily get along with most people no matter what 
                    their interest, because I most likely have something 
                    in common with them.

                    Recently my hobby has been music production and just 
                    attending as many festivals and events that I have time 
                    for. The production is coming along slowly as there's 
                    always a learning curve. I've been interested in genres 
                    like hip hop and rock most of my life, but recently 
                    electronic music has made me really enjoy life to the 
                    fullest.
